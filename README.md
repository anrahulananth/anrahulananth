I'm a web and mobile applications developer. I am your typical millennial. I spent most of my childhood playing video games. I started my programming journey in with LOGO 🐢 during school days and fell in love with programming ever since.

I design and develop responsive desktop and mobile web applications. I also like working on search engine optimisation, analytics. Most of my time is spent on reading tech articles 📰, playing video games 🎮, coding 💻.

Currently I'm working as a Full Stack Engineer at Lowe's India

I like to travel 🚋, go on hikes 🌄, binge-watch TV shows 📺, enjoy good music 🎵 and read books 📚.
